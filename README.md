## What is 'code\_steps'?

This project aims to give anyone interested in teaching Computer Science concepts the tools to do so in an effective and interactive way.

Check out the site live at [ahirsch.be/code\_steps](https://www.ahirsch.be/code_steps/web/).

### I can turn my own code into interactive lessons??
You sure can, and right from the site, too! It's still kinda janky, so if you run into issues, please file an issue on our [issues page](https://github.com/ahirschberg/code_steps/issues). Currently the lessons are only stored in your browser's LocalStorage, but progress should be made on that soon. Thanks so much for trying it out.

## Contributing to the project
I'm making this for free and in my free time, and I'd love your contributions.  The project is written in Dart and Angular 2, with some JavaScript to interface with existing JavaScript libraries. The project also has Codeship set up as a continuous deployment solution, which runs the `ci/deploy.sh` script in the repo.
